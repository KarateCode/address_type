Description:
  This is the base generator for the plugin 'address_type'.  Only run this once.  It is
  basically a scaffold generator for address.  It provides the base class that all
  dynamically generated address_types will inherit from.

Example:
    ./script/generate address_base

    This will create :
        Controller: app/controllers/addresses_controller.rb
        Model:      app/models/account.rb
        Views:      app/views
                        edit.html.erb
                        show.html.erb
                        index.html.erb
                        new.html.erb
