Description:
  This is where the magic happens.  This generator will make a new model that will take advantage
  of rails built-in single table inheritance mechanism.  This is quite ideal because the the fields
  and functionality of the model 'address' is inherited, while every new model can have its own 
  relationships.  A line will also be added to routes that makes your site look and feel like it 
  has a new controller, although it is really funneling through the generic addresses controller.
  This is advantageous on two levels: your site now has new webpages devoted to CRUDing that data, 
  but you don't have a bazillion new files cluttering up your project.
  
  
  
  For example, if you wanted a user to have only one billing, but multiple shipping 
  addresses:
  
  # ruby script/generate address_type billing
  # ruby script/generate address_type shipping
  
    # app/models/billing.rb
    class Billing < Address
      belongs_to :user
    end

    # app/models/shipping.rb
    class Shipping < Address
      belongs_to :user
    end
    
    # app/models/user.rb
    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_one :billing
      has_many :shipping
    end
    

Example:
    ./script/generate address_type billing

    This will create :
        Routes: routes.rb: map.resources 'billing_addresses', :controller => 'addresses'
        Model:  app/models/billing.rb
